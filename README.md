# Solana Counter Program Framework Comparison

This repository is part of a Solana Program Development artefact that showcases different implementations of two programs (Counter and TokenSwap) across various Solana program frameworks. The goal is to compare and contrast the developer experience, code structure, and capabilities of different frameworks.

## Current Implementations

### Counter program

- **Anchor** - Located in `counter/anchor-program/` ✅
- **Pinocchio** - Located in `counter/pinocchio-program/` ✅
- **Typhoon** ⚠️ WIP
- **Star** ⚠️ WIP
- **Steel** ⚠️ WIP

### TokenSwap program

- **Anchor** - Located in `token-mint/anchor-program/` ✅
- **Pinocchio** - Located in `token-mint/pinocchio-program/` ✅
- **Typhoon** ⚠️ WIP
- **Star** ⚠️ WIP
- **Steel** ⚠️ WIP

## Purpose

This comparison helps developers:

- Understand the differences between Solana program frameworks
- Make informed decisions about which framework to use for their projects
- Learn framework-specific patterns and best practices
- Compare code complexity and developer ergonomics

Each implementation demonstrates the same core functionality (Counter and TokenSwap programs) while highlighting the unique approaches and features of each framework.
